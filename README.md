# Problem Statement

Proposed By - Prof. Arnab Paul

There's a website called [CSRankings](http://csrankings.org) that ranks universities worldwide based on their publications in top computer science conferences. However these conferences are often too expensive for many academics in India and other developing countries to attend because of where they're held. Instead, in places like India, top computer science faculty members usually publish in conferences listed as Core A\*/A according to the ranking provided by [CORE](http://portal.core.edu.au/conf-ranks/), or in Q1 journals (or transactions) as listed on [Scimago Journal & Country Rank](https://www.scimagojr.com/journalrank.php). So, the goal of this project is to take the existing CS Rankings website and adapt it to fit India's standards for high-quality research. We'll use the same criteria for ranking faculty members, sub-areas in computer science, and so on. Initially, we'll focus on institutions like IISc, all IITs, BITS (across all campuses), NITs, IIITs, ISI, TIFR, CMI, and IMSc. This project could make a significant contribution to the computer science community in India by providing a more relevant and accessible ranking system.

# Solution

We have created a website that ranks universities in India based on their publications in top computer science conferences. We have used the same criteria for ranking faculty members, sub-areas in computer science, and so on. We have initially focused on institutions like IISc, all IITs, BITS (across all campuses), NITs, IIITs, ISI, TIFR, CMI, and IMSc. This project could make a significant contribution to the computer science community in India by providing a more relevant and accessible ranking system.
